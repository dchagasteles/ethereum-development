## Account Abstraction (AA) Technology
**Account Abstraction** is a concept that aims to enhance the user experience in blockchain systems by making accounts more flexible and programmable. In traditional blockchain systems, there are two types of accounts:

1. **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)**: Controlled by private keys, typically belonging to users.
2. **Contract Accounts**: Controlled by code, typically smart contracts.

Account Abstraction blurs the lines between these two types by allowing the logic that determines the validity of a transaction to be embedded within the account itself, not just in the blockchain protocol.

**Key Features of Account Abstraction:**
**Customizable Transaction Logic**: Users can define custom logic for transaction validation, such as multi-signature requirements or rate limiting.
**Improved Security**: By embedding security checks directly in the account, users can prevent certain types of attacks.
**User Experience**: Enables features like meta-transactions, where a third party can pay for gas fees on behalf of the user.


## Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
**Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)** are a concept from Solana but can be adapted to other blockchain protocols. PDAs are addresses derived from a seed value and a program ID, making them predictable and deterministic.

**How PDAs Work:**
- Seed Value: A base value used to derive the address.
- Program ID: A unique identifier for the program (smart contract) generating the address.
- Deterministic: The same seed and program ID will always generate the same PDA.

PDAs are particularly useful for creating addresses that need to interact with specific smart contracts, ensuring that funds or data sent to these addresses are automatically handled by the designated program.

## Degen
**Degen** is a slang term in the cryptocurrency and DeFi communities referring to someone who engages in high-risk, speculative trading or investing, often with little regard for due diligence or the potential for losses. The term is short for "degenerate," highlighting the reckless nature of such behavior.

## CDP
At its core, a **Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)** is a **smart contract-based system** that enables users to lock up their cryptocurrency holdings as **collateral** to generate **loans** in the form of stablecoins or other tokens.

## Bonding
**"bonding"** generally refers to a mechanism that **locks up** a certain amount of cryptocurrency or tokens as a security deposit to ensure the performance of certain actions or to secure participation in a network.

## What are the primary layers of blockchain technology?
Blockchain consists of **five** layers: **hardware infrastructure**, **data**, **network**, **consensus**, and **application layers**. These layers handle functions from **data storage to user-facing applications**.

## What are the key differences between blockchain layers 0, 1, 2, and 3?
1. **Layer 0** includes foundational elements like hardware and protocols.
2. **Layer 1** maintains dispute resolution, consensus mechanisms, and blockchain programming (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
3. **Layer 2** offers better scaling capabilities and third-party integration.
4. **Layer 3** hosts decentralized applications (dApps) and user-facing applications.ss

## Pre-sale and Merkle Tree
**Merkle trees** provide a secure and efficient way to manage and verify transactions and data in **pre-sales**, ensuring transparency, integrity, and scalability in the token distribution process.

## 0DTE ( zero-days-to-expiration )
A **0DTE** option is an **options contract set to expire at the end of the current trading day**. Every options contract on an underlying optionable, index, stock, or ETF, whether it was issued a month ago or just last week, becomes a 0DTE on its expiration date.

## At-The-Money
**At the money (ATM)** is a **situation where an option's strike price is identical to the current market price of the underlying security**. An ATM option has a delta of ±0.50, positive if it is a call, negative for a put. Both call and put options can be simultaneously ATM.

## European Option
A **European option** is the **type of options contract that allows investors to exercise their options only on the expiration date of that contract**. The contract holder has the right to buy or sell the underlying securities for a specified price; it is known as the **strike price** of the option.

## American Option
An **American option** is a **style of options contract that allows holders to exercise their rights at any time before and including the expiration date**. An American-style option allows investors to capture profit as soon as the stock price moves favorably.

## Underlying security
**Underlying security** is a **term in investing that denotes the negotiable financial instrument upon which a financial derivative, such as an option on a stock – is based**. Therefore, the value of the underlying security also determines the value of its financial derivative.

## Option Contract
An **option contract** is a **promise to keep an offer open for another party to accept within a period of time**. With an option contract, the offeror is not permitted to revoke the offer within the stated period of time. Most option contracts require consideration and other contract formalities in order to be enforceable.
